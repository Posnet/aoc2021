    "first": "\\--- Day 7: The Treachery of Whales ---\n----------\n\nA giant [whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale) has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!\n\nSuddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a *massive underground cave system* just beyond where they're aiming!\n\nThe crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?\n\nThere's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.\n\nYou quickly make a list of *the horizontal position of each crab* (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.\n\nFor example, consider the following horizontal positions:\n\n```\n16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14\n```\n\nThis means there's a crab with horizontal position `16`, a crab with horizontal position `1`, and so on.\n\nEach change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position `2`:\n\n* Move from `16` to `2`: `14` fuel\n* Move from `1` to `2`: `1` fuel\n* Move from `2` to `2`: `0` fuel\n* Move from `0` to `2`: `2` fuel\n* Move from `4` to `2`: `2` fuel\n* Move from `2` to `2`: `0` fuel\n* Move from `7` to `2`: `5` fuel\n* Move from `1` to `2`: `1` fuel\n* Move from `2` to `2`: `0` fuel\n* Move from `14` to `2`: `12` fuel\n\nThis costs a total of `*37*` fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position `1` (`41` fuel), position `3` (`39` fuel), or position `10` (`71` fuel).\n\nDetermine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. *How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?*\n\nYour puzzle answer was `364898`.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\--- Part Two ---\n----------\n\nThe crabs don't seem interested in your proposed solution. Perhaps you misunderstand crab engineering?\n\nAs it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate. Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first step costs `1`, the second step costs `2`, the third step costs `3`, and so on.\n\nAs each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive. This changes the best horizontal position to align them all on; in the example above, this becomes `5`:\n\n* Move from `16` to `5`: `66` fuel\n* Move from `1` to `5`: `10` fuel\n* Move from `2` to `5`: `6` fuel\n* Move from `0` to `5`: `15` fuel\n* Move from `4` to `5`: `1` fuel\n* Move from `2` to `5`: `6` fuel\n* Move from `7` to `5`: `3` fuel\n* Move from `1` to `5`: `10` fuel\n* Move from `2` to `5`: `6` fuel\n* Move from `14` to `5`: `45` fuel\n\nThis costs a total of `*168*` fuel. This is the new cheapest possible outcome; the old alignment position (`2`) now costs `206` fuel instead.\n\nDetermine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible so they can make you an escape route! *How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?*\n\nAnswer:\n\nAlthough it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](7/input).",
