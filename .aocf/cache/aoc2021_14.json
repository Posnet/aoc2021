    "first": "\\--- Day 14: Extended Polymerization ---\n----------\n\nThe incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on your submarine. The submarine has [polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization) equipment that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.\n\nThe submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it offers a *polymer template* and a list of *pair insertion* rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nNNCB\n\nCH -> B\nHH -> N\nCB -> H\nNH -> C\nHB -> C\nHC -> B\nHN -> C\nNN -> C\nBH -> H\nNC -> B\nNB -> B\nBN -> B\nBB -> N\nBC -> B\nCC -> N\nCN -> C\n\n```\n\nThe first line is the *polymer template* - this is the starting point of the process.\n\nThe following section defines the *pair insertion* rules. A rule like `AB -> C` means that when elements `A` and `B` are immediately adjacent, element `C` should be inserted between them. These insertions all happen simultaneously.\n\nSo, starting with the polymer template `NNCB`, the first step simultaneously considers all three pairs:\n\n* The first pair (`NN`) matches the rule `NN -> C`, so element `*C*` is inserted between the first `N` and the second `N`.\n* The second pair (`NC`) matches the rule `NC -> B`, so element `*B*` is inserted between the `N` and the `C`.\n* The third pair (`CB`) matches the rule `CB -> H`, so element `*H*` is inserted between the `C` and the `B`.\n\nNote that these pairs overlap: the second element of one pair is the first element of the next pair. Also, because all pairs are considered simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered to be part of a pair until the next step.\n\nAfter the first step of this process, the polymer becomes `N*C*N*B*C*H*B`.\n\nHere are the results of a few steps using the above rules:\n\n```\nTemplate:     NNCB\nAfter step 1: NCNBCHB\nAfter step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB\nAfter step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB\nAfter step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB\n\n```\n\nThis polymer grows quickly. After step 5, it has length 97; After step 10, it has length 3073. After step 10, `B` occurs 1749 times, `C` occurs 298 times, `H` occurs 161 times, and `N` occurs 865 times; taking the quantity of the most common element (`B`, 1749) and subtracting the quantity of the least common element (`H`, 161) produces `1749 - 161 = *1588*`.\n\nApply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. *What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?*\n\nYour puzzle answer was `2345`.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\--- Part Two ---\n----------\n\nThe resulting polymer isn't nearly strong enough to reinforce the submarine. You'll need to run more steps of the pair insertion process; a total of *40 steps* should do it.\n\nIn the above example, the most common element is `B` (occurring `2192039569602` times) and the least common element is `H` (occurring `3849876073` times); subtracting these produces `*2188189693529*`.\n\nApply *40* steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. *What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?*\n\nAnswer:\n\nAlthough it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](14/input).",
